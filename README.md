# Data Science Workflow

In real simple what data sicientist do is :

Data scientists work closely with business stakeholders to understand their goals and determine how data can be used to achieve those goals. They design data modeling processes, create algorithms and predictive models to extract the data the business needs, then help analyze the data and share insights with peers.
